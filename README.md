# toronto-cycling-speed-analysis

This is code for the project I worked on for part of my work term at the University of Toronto, 
working under Eric Miller, PhD.
The project involves creating a model for bicycle speeds on urban cycling routes, based on data
collected from the City of Toronto's bicycle tracking mobile app.
